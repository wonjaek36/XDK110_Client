#XDK110_Client


##Introduction

XDK 110 inclusives multiple micro electromechanical systems sensors, various parameters for condition monitoring or predictive maintenance get recorded .Furthermore ,drivers for all system components included.It posses PC and MAC based development tools for Windows, LINUX and MacOS.

This code is client side of collecting data via 8 sensors through UDP from XDK 110 .

#### Operation Conditions :

* Indoor use
* Operating temperature range (-20 ºC ~ 60 °C, (0 °C ~ 45 °C for battery charging))
* Storage temperature range (-20 ºC ~ 60 °C)
* Humidity range 10~90 %rH (non-condensing)
* Supply Voltage 5 V DC
* IP Rating : IP 30 (IEC 60529) [IP 30 : First Digit is Solids Protection and Second Digit is Liquids Protection]
  `The first digit indicates the level of protection that the enclosure provides against access to hazardous parts (e.g., electrical conductors, moving parts) and the ingress of solid foreign objects.The second digit indicates protection of the equipment inside the enclosure against harmful ingress of water.`
 

#### Sensor APIs :

>###### 1.Accelerometer ( BMA280 ):
   Type:collecting X , Y and Z axis values and shows the rate of change of the speed and velocity of an object<br />
   Range: -2 ~ +2 g (programmable : mutable range )<br />
   Rate: 2000 Hz<br />
   Unit: g (G-forced = g )<br />


>###### 2.Magnetometer ( BMM150 ):
   Type:magnetometer is a triple-axis smart digital magnetometer that detects the strength and direction of a magnetic field and communicates    the x, y and z components directly to the server.Magnetometer API returns the sensor values in the unit µT, which is equivalent to µVs/m2.    <br />
   Range: ±1300 μT (X,Y-Axis); ±2500μT (Z-Axis)<br />
   Rate: 300 Hz<br />
   Unit: μT (micro Tesla)<br />


>###### 3.Gyroscope ( BMG160 ):
   Type:collecting data via 3-axis gyroscope sensor.Gyroscope sensor senses angular velocity. In simple terms, angular velocity is the            change in rotational angle per unit of time(degrees-per-second)<br />
   Range: ±125 º/s ~ ±2000 º/s (programmable  : mutable range)<br />
   Rate: 2000 Hz<br /> 
   Unit: deg/s (degrees-per-second)<br />


>###### 4.Humidity ( BME280 ): 
   Type: This sensor presents the water vapor in the atmosphere. The more water evaporates in a given area, the more water vapor rises into      the air, and the higher the humidity of that area is. Hot places tend to be more humid than cool places because heat causes water to          evaporate faster.
   Range: 10 ~ 90 %rH (non-condensing)[limited by XDK operating conditions]<br />
   Rate: 182 Hz<br /> 
   Unit: %rh (percentage relative humidity)<br />


>###### 5.Pressure ( BME280 ):
   Type: It is the force exerted on a surface by the air above it as gravity pulls it to Earth. 
   Range: 300 ~ 1100 hPa (Hectopascals)<br />
   Rate: 182 Hz<br /> 
   Unit: Pa (Pascal)<br />

>###### 6.Light:
   Type: The light sensor is a passive devices that convert this light energy whether visible or in the infrared parts of the spectrum into      an electrical signal output.
   Range: 0.045 lux ~ 188,000 lux ; 22-bit<br />
   Rate: -<br />
   Unit: lux (Illuminance is a measurement of the light intensity at any point. It is equal to 1 Lumen per square meter.)<br />


>###### 7.Noise:
   Type: This sound sensor is a diaphragm that converts air pressure vibrations into electrical signals that are conveyed to the server.
   Range: average voltage peaks of 500-700 mV<br />
   Rate: - <br />
   Unit: mV (Mega Volt)<br />


>###### 8.Temperature ( BME280 ):
   Type: Temperature Sensor measures the amount of heat energy or even coldness that is generated by an object or system, allowing us to          sense or detect any physical change to that temperature producing a digital output.
   Range: -20 ºC ~ 60 °C (per degree Centigrade) [limited by XDK operating conditions]<br />
   Rate: 182 Hz<br /> 
   Unit: °C (degree Centigrade)<br />
